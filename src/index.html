You can see a real life migration of a 2D game with the Canvas3D API:
* [Using CanvasRenderingContext2D](css/main/windwaker/index.html).
* [Using Canvas3D](css/main/windwaker/index.html?Canvas3D).
        
# This page is a test case of what Canvas3D emulates

In all the samples below, the canvas on the left use CanvasRenderingContext2D__ and the one on the right uses __Canvas3D__. You can perform speed tests for every example.

## drawImage()
The performance increases when you have a lot of images to display.
But you have to be aware of slight differences in the usage due to internal optimization.
For instance, compare both results:        
        <test:drawImageBad images="sprite1, sprite2"/>
As you can see, painting order is not respected.
This is because the optimisation consist in buffering sprites and writing them all at once at flushing time.
And to stick with `drawImage()` usage, each image has its own sprites buffer.
In this example, we draw 3 sprites from 2 different images.
That's why the API creates two buffers and it flushes them one after the other.

You may think that you can use depth test to prevent that to occur, but it's a bad idea with transparency.     
        
        <test:drawImageDepth images="sprite1, sprite2"/>

The only way to be sure that the painting order is respected is to use an unique image.
That means you have to create an atlas like this one :
        
        <img src="css/main/atlas.png" style="border: 1px solid #000">

Not only the atlas will respect the painting order, but it boosts performances because the API have only one buffer to flush.        
                
        <test:drawImageFast images="atlas"/>

__Warning!__ Any time you use a transformation, the API will flush all the buffers.
So be careful, because this drops down the performance a lot.
        
        <test:drawImage images="sprite1, sprite2"/>

## fillRect()
Filling rectangles is made with the buffer/flush optimization.
That means it is very fast until you want to use transformations.
        
        <test:fillRect/>

Using styles can slow down a little, especially if you use the `hls()`.
The fastest syntax are `#RGB` and `#RRGGBB`.        
        <test:fillRectWithFillStyle/>
        <test:fillRectWithFillStyleAndAlpha/>

## Transformations        
        <test:saveRestore loops="1000"/>
As usual, transformations are slow. You can use this code to get speed.        
        <test:saveRestoreFast loops="1000"/>
        <test:rotateAndTranslate/>
        <test:rotate/>
        <test:translate/>

## Path        
        <test:fill/>
